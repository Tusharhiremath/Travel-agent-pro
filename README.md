A smart multi-agent system that helps users plan trips by combining:

- **Parent Agent** → orchestrates child agents  
- **Weather Agent** → gets current temperature + precipitation probability using **Open-Meteo**  
- **Places Agent** → suggests up to 5 attractions using **Overpass API**  
- **Geocoding Agent** → uses **Nominatim** to convert place → coordinates
